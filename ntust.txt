f(gambar kucing) = "cat"

regression 

what is regression ?
one of machine learning task 
output a scalar 

case study : estimating the combat power of a pokemon 

parameters
x mmeans one pokemon
xcp means pokemon's current xp
xs means pokemon's species
xhp means pokemon's hp
xw means pokemon's weight 
f() means the function
y means the output

how to set up the function model 
according to our experience 
use the linear model 

y = b + w . xcp 

step 2 : goodness of function 
loss function 
input : a function from the model
output : how good or bad it is 

step 3 : pick the best function
components we have at the present
  function set
  training data
  loss function 

gradient descent 

example for model y = w * x
loss function " y^

4 steps for gradient descent 
step 1 : pick an initial value w0
step 2 : compute dL/dw | w = w0

negative -> increase w
positive -> decrease w 

step 3 : increase or decrease weight 
  determine the step size 
  set up the learning rate 
step 4 : get the w*

back to the pokemon case 

use testing data 

how can we do better for prediction
add the complexity for your model 
overfitting ? model selection, good for testing bad for training 
add related features into model 


CLASSIFICATION 
what is classification'one of machine learning task
output is discrete (class)

case study : predict the types of pokemon 
training data : number 1-400 pokemon 

in ideal : only identify 2 class - water type and other type 
step 1 : set up the function model 
function : 
  g(x) > 0 output = class 1
  else output = class 2
  
step 2 : set up the loss function 
in classification - find the lower value in loss function

step 3 : find the best function 
perceptron & svm
why not gradient descent - loss function is undifferential
other solution : generative model

GENERATIVE MODEL 

likelihood function == loss function 
find maximum likelihood
use partial differentiation 

quick conclusion of using generative model 
  function set
  
logistic regression 
conclusions from generative model 
  z = wx + b 
step 1 : function set (model)
sigmoid function 

step 2 : goodness of function 
training data : f

derive the likelihood function 
argmin (-ln(L(w,b)))

step 3 : find the best function
