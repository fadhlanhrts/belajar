junos os fundamentals

junos os is used for routing, switching, and
security devices

junos os is divided into multiple parts 
a robust modular os 
if one process fails the whole system does not
freebsd or linux

junos os is a single software release 

separation of control and forwarding
routing and switching process are separated from 
forwarding frames and packets
goal : clean separation of control and forwarding functions

routing engine (RE)
brain of the platform, responsible for performing
protocol updates and system management
acts as the control plane 
based on x86 or powerpc
maintains the routing table, bridging table, and forwarding table
connects to the packet forwarding engine through an internal link 

packet forwarding engine (PFE)
runs on separate hardware and forwards transit traffic
uses application speficif IC (ASIC)
central processing component
synchronized copy of the forwarding table 
uses layer 2 and 3 forwarding table 
policers, state of firewalls, class of services 

transit traffic
traffic entering ingress port will be forwarded
by forwarding plane
PFE uses the copied forwarding table
junos os can maintain high performance by doing so 
can be multicast and unicast 

exception traffic 
does not pass through the local device 
processed by the local system 
requires special handling
ex : routing protocol updates, ip packets with the ip options field
rate limited on the internal link to protect from dos attacks

overview of junos devices 
provides end to end ip infrastructure
routing devices : ptx series, mx series, acx series 
switching devices : ex series, qfx series 
security devices : srx series, 
sdn products : nfx series, contrail cloud, northstar controller, mplsview

junos os can also run as a vm using vmware or kvm 
vmx virtual router 
software emulation of router 
ensures that vmx packet handling is identical to physical router 


junos cli 

junos os offers 2 ui : cli & j web interface
junos cli : text based command shell, can be accessed through out of band serial console
j-web interface : web based GUI using http or https, installed on most platform running the junos os

junos os requires username and password
when logging in non root users are placed into the CLI automatically 
amnesiac - nama hostname 

start cli : type cli 
logout : exit 

cli modes : operational & configuration 
operational : monitor, ping, show, test, traceroute
used for monitoring and troubleshooting 
sign : >

configuration : configure interface, protocol, user access
sign : #

type ? for help (mirip cisco) 

clear ? atau ? aja bisa
