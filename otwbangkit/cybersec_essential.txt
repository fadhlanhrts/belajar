CHAPTER 2 : cybersecurity cube 
principles of security
  confidentiality, integrity, availability
  c : prevents the disclosure of information 
  i : accuracy, consistency, trustworthiness
  a : ensures that information is accessible
  
three states of data
  data in transit
  data at rest or in storage
  data in process

cybersecurity safeguards
  technological tools
  establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines

the principle of confidentiality
  prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people
  data encryption, authentication, and access control 


protecting data privacy
  personal identifiable information
  business information
  classified information
 
controlling access 
  authentication, authorization, and accounting
  authentication
    something they know (password)
    something they have (card)
    something they are (fingerprint)
 
 authorization
  determines which resources users can access
 
 accounting
  keep track of what users do



2.2.2.1 - principle of data integrity
integrity - accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data
methods - hashing, data validation checks, data consistency checks

need for data integrity
critical level - healthcare and emergency services
high level - ecommerce and analitycs
mid level - online sales and search engines
low level - blogs and personal posting sites


integrity checks 
a way to measure the consistency of a collection of data
example of hash function - checksum 
md5, sha-1, sha-256 





2.2.3.1 - principle of availability
maintaining availability of information system
methods - system redundancy, system backups, equipment maintanance
design principles of high availability systems
  eliminate single points of failure
  provide for reliable crossover
  detect failures as they occur 
five nines design principles
  standardized systems
  shared component systems
  clustering

ensuring availability
  equipment maintenance
  os and system updates
  backup testing
  disaster planning
  new technology  implementations
  unusual activity monitoring
  availability testing



2.3 states of data
2.3.1 data at rest
types of data storage
  direct attached storage - hard drive
  raid
  network attached storage 
  storage area network
  cloud
  
2.3.2 data in transit
methods of transmitting data
  sneaker net - usb
  wired networks
  wireless networks
challenges of protecting data in transit
  protecting data confidentiality
  protecting data integrity
  protecting data availability

2.3.3 data in process
data during initial input, modification, computation
data corruption occurs during data output 



2.4.1 technologies
software based tech
  software firewalls
  network and port scanners
  protocol analyzer
  vulnerability scanners
  intrusion detection system
  
hardware based tech
  firewall appliances
  ids
  ips
  content filtering services

network based tech
  vpn
  nac
  wap security

cloud based tech
  saas
  iaas
  paas
  
policies
  identification and authentication policies
  password policies
  acceptable use policies - identifies network resources and usage
  that are acceptable to the organization
  remote access policies
  network maintenance policies
  incident handling policies
  

2.5.1 iso cybersecurity model 
twelve domains of cybersecurity
  risk assessment
  security policy
  organization of information security
  asset management
  human resource security
  physical and environmental security
  communciations and operations management
  information systems aacquisition, development and maintenance
  access control
  information security incident management
  business continuity management
  compliance
  

CHAPTER 3
3.1 malware and malicious code
virus
  malicious executable code attached to another file 
  melissa virus - spread via email
worms
  malicious code that replicates by independently exploiting vulnerability in networks
  ex - code red worm
trojan horse 
  malware that carries out malicious operations under the guise of a desired operation

logic bombs
  malicious program that uses a trigger to awaken the malicious code

ransomware 
  holds a computer system, user must pay 

backdoor and rootkit
  backdoor - bypasses the normal authentication, grant cyber criminals access to unauthorized system users
  rootkit - modifies the operating system to create a backdoor 
  
defending against malware
  antivirus
  up to date software

3.1.2 email and browser attacks
spam
  no subject line
  requesting an update to an account
spyware, adware, and scareware
phising
vhising
  phising using voip
smishing 
  phising using text message
pharming
  impersonation of a legitimate website
whaling


3.1.2.5 browser plugins
plugins
  flash player exploitation - system crash, criminal taking control of the affected system
SEO poisoning - increase traffic to malicious site 
browser hijacker - alters a browser's settings to redirect to websites paid for by the cyber criminals customer


defending against email and browser attacks
  educating the user
  defend against spam - isp filter, antivirus
  keeping all software updated 
  

3.2.1.1 social engineering
pretexting - attacker calls an individual 
something for something (quid pro quo)

social engineering tactics
  authority
  intimidation
  consensus - people will take action if they think other people like it too
  scarcity - people will... if there is a limited quanity
  urgency - people will... if there is limited time
  familiatiy
  trust
  

shoulder surfing & dumpster diving
impersonation and hoaxes
piggybacking & tailgating
  give appearance of being escorted by the authorized individual
  join a large crowd pretendong to be a member
  target a victim who is careless sbout the rules of the facility

defending against deception
  never provide confidential information via email, chat sessions, in person
  resist the urge to click on enticing emails
  keep an eye out for uninitiated or automatic downloads
  do not fall to pressure from unknown individuals


3.3.1 cyber attacks
